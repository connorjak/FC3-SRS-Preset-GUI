# FC3-SRS-Preset-GUI

Set up DCS Simple Radio Standalone preset channels through an interactive script.

Not really a GUI for now, more a terminal UI. F-15 2 UHF radios only, for now.

Run using `python preset_gui.py` from the terminal, with Python installed. Any Python 3 version should be fine.

# Installation
See [Releases](https://github.com/connorjak/FC3-SRS-Preset-GUI/releases).
